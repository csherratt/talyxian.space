   Each sample (left & right for stereo, just the sample for mono),
   regardless of size (16 bit vc 8 bit) needs 8 bytes in dma-able form.
   We need two sets of both input & output dma buffers, for a total of four.

	the param buffer has the following fields

command:	long	0		// driver command
status:		long	0		// driver status
control:	long	0		// driver control
frame_control:	long	0		// (in) data control info

The command field is where driver command id's go.  On each pass the
driver checks for a command id, runs the command if nay, and returns
a result code (0=success, -1=failure) in this field.

The status word is pretty useless. Ignore it.

The control word is where a parameter goes for whatever command get issued
to the driver.  See audio.h and the sample application for details.

The data control info is exactly what the AD1849 codec expects.  See the
1849 spec for details, or see audio_hw.h.

The layout of the param section, and the 'API' for issuing commands will
probably change to more closely match the way AT&T did it.  Stay tuned...
