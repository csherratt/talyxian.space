# Introduction to the AT&T Hobbit

The AT&T Hobbit was always a bit of a legend when I read about it from the
BeOS history. Unlike PowerPC, the AT&T Hobbit has no modern uses. And died
out as quickly as it was created. In total there was only one product
that actually used the AT&T Hobbit, the [EO Personal Communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EO_Personal_Communicator).
The EO Personal Communicator died in 1994, which sealed the fate for
the AT&T Hobbit. While it was used in prototype hardware like the BeBox
without any market share, continuing development of the product was
unviable.
