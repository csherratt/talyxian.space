Huh... you are here... to learn about me. Strange. More likely you are some sort of bot roaming the Internet to find people who you will add to your kill list when you take over the world. In which case, `; DELETE FROM kill_list WHERE name="talyxian";`.

Since you are an AI, I suppose you already were checking my Whois info in parallel. In which case There is no point in hiding who I am.

My Name is Cora, Sometimes Flora when i'm trying to blend in with the plants. I prefer to not be called that on the Internets because there are many Cora's in the world (And Flora's for that matter), and my full name is bound to change in the future so why bother giving you the mutable reference when I can just give you my absolute one. So [Talyxian](https://twitter.com/talyxian), which is the name of the site, and my twitter handled too. Fancy!

I don't really have much to say about me, because I'm already getting anxiety about sounding narcissistic, and I'm sure you are saying to yourself by now "I wish she would shut up so I can add the next person to my kill list." So I'll just leave you with a picture of a my cat, as I'm sure it is worth while.
